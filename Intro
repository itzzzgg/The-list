Every day, At least 7 times Emma/Olivia says they are going to kill themselves, Are in the hospital or lose a loved one. Every day I help to all my extent trying my best to keep everything calm but everyday they say they are fine and the next it happens again. I gave her the numbers, The help, The support. I even held a funeral for their cat that they were still posting picture about this morning even though it died last night (Context for the cat post they stated the cat woke them up which is implying they are alive, I don't imagine a dead limp cat jumping on a sleeping human) I'm trying my best and they get offended when I don't help them. If you fake suicide for attention I will be adding you to a list that is going public soon, You will be exposed and you won't be forgiven.
